# Vagrant
I use vagrant with VirtualBox. You can also use other hypervisors.

## Basic Usage
vagrant box list
vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64
mkdir icacvm
cd icacvm

## Notable edits in Vagrantfile
-- Port forwarding
-- VM networking
-- Memory
-- Provisoning
-- Shared folders
-- Turn off headless mode

If you make edits to the Vagrantfile, you must reload or create a new vm for the changes to take effect.

## Controlling VM (commands run on host)
vagrant up # Start up VM
vagrant status # Shows state of VM
vagrant ssh # SSH into VM. Don't have to remember ports :)
vagrant suspend # Suspend the VM
vagrant halt # Power off the VM
vagrant destroy # Delete the VM

## More advanced
vagrant global-status
Create your own Vagrant box that you can share with others.

## Virtual Box specific
vboxmanage list vms 
vboxmanage list runningvms # Gives you a list of VMIDs
vboxmanage controlvm poweroff VMID

If your vagrant VM gets wedged, vboxmanage can terminate it. In some versions of Virtual Box, you had to go into the GUI, select the VM and unlock changes.

# Devstack

## Getting Devstack
Get latest info from: http://devstack.org/

On a fresh Ubuntu12.04-14.04 machine, I usually do:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git
cd devstack

## Controlling your devstack installation

Create a new file called local.conf (used to be called localrc). The old file format still works but you get some more powerful capabilities with the new format. In a nutshell, the new format has various sections. You can put modifications to nova.conf, cinder.conf, etc. in various sections but the neat thing is that it is all in one file. Here is a Basic config with one section:
[[local|localrc]]

FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.1.224/27
FIXED_RANGE=10.11.12.0/24
FIXED_NETWORK_SIZE=256
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth0
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secretpassword
MYSQL_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
VIRT_DRIVER=fake
NUMBER_FAKE_NOVA_COMPUTE=100

## Lets take our devstack for a spin
source openrc admin admin # We must specify a user as well as a tenant
nova hypervisor-list
nova image-list

## Flavors
nova flavor-list
nova flavor-create m1.newflavor 611 10 0 1

## Setup keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa
nova keypair-list
nova keypair-add --pub-key foo.pub newkey

## Security Groups
nova secgroup-list
nova secgroup-list-rules default
nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0

# Heat
heat stack-list
heat create -f basic.yml stackname
heat template-show testicac
heat stack-show testicac
heat resource-list testicac
